# Guardrail test and common mistakes

## The guardrail, as a test

The engine's self-test is the proof the guardrail holds:
```sh
appbox intake --self-test
```
It asserts, negatively: feed N surfaces, the emitted registry has exactly N
(no invented entries); every `surface` is `null`; every `inferred` field is
marked in the brief and the mark does not leak onto `client` fields; bad
provenance / malformed ids / duplicate ids are all rejected and named.

## Common mistakes

- **Inventing a field the client did not state.** If they were silent, the
  field is `inferred` with a placeholder, or absent. Never fabricate a
  requirement with `client` provenance.
- **Binding a `surface`.** Intake names; design binds. A non-null surface in a
  seed means intake did design's job — the self-test fails it.
- **Rephrasing the client.** Capture verbatim. Polishing their words is editing
  the brief, which is generation by another name.
- **Forgetting intake is optional.** Forcing it on a first run costs the buyer
  the demo that earns trust. A hand-written brief, or none at all, is valid.
- **Trusting the emit without validating.** `emit` validates internally and
  refuses to write on error, but run `validate` while you author to catch
  provenance and id mistakes early.
